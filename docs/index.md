## Ogallala Notes

### About
These are notes compiled, edited and distilled for [Ogallala Life](https://www.ogallala.life), a non-profit foundation operating out of Amarillo, TX organized around using blockchain and web3 technologies to create incentives for adopting regenerative practices that can help restore watershed health in the lands surrounding the Ogallala Aquifer.  

These are *notes*, not fact-checked publications. They are meant primarily as resource for the stakeholders and organizers of Ogallala Life and are compiled as a result of direct comunications with them. They are made publicly available so that interested parties have a basis for research already done and where they might fit in. In that regard, the pages published here are dynamic documents.
